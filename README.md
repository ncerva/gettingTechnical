# gettingTechnical

This is a CMS style blog built from scratch. 
It follows the MVC paradigm, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and express for npm package for authentication. 

The goal of this tech blog is to give users the ability to comment and post on a tech blog. Users must log in to have this functionality, otherwise, they can only view posts. Once user is logged in, they can comment and post and also view their activity in their dashboard. If user is idle for a specific amount of time, the session will time out.
